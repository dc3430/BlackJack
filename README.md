# How to play
Welcome, BlackJack it's also known as twenty-one. 
This is one of my favorite game when going to a casino. 
Plus, it's a very easy game to learn. 
I hope that this fun, but easy game become one of your favorite games to play.

In my game of BlackJack, you are up against another player. This can be a friend or if you feel like you need the practice you can play alone.
First, we start out playing the game by clicking on the start button.
Both players are dealt two cards from the moment you hit start.
We will be playing BlackJack with one deck of cards. The cards are counted as their respective values.
Like normal card games the respected value of the card represented on the card.
A two is worth two point, a three is worth three point, ect. 
Face cards value are ten and in my gmae the aces values is worth eleven.
The point of BlackJack is to beat the other player without Busting, how you bust might you ask is have your cards value add up to be higher than twenty-one. 
If the cards value equals to twenty-one you are a winner!!!
You can draw as many cards as needed to not exceed twenty-one in order to beat the other player.
If you think the value of your cards is high enough to beat your opponents you don't have to draw any card you can just click the stay button.
Other wise you should click the hit but to try to reach the score of 21 or have the highest value of card on the table.

When a hand of BlackJack is played out between the players, there are three out comes. first you can win players can win from the start of the game with a hand of an ace and a face card.
 Secondly you can lose by bust, players also can lose from the being of the game if the are dealt two aces.
Thirdly players can tie which is also called a push where the value add to be the same.

I have some advice for you, if the value of your hand is between eleven and sixteen I would recommand you to hit. 
The name of the game is to reach twenty-one or become the player with the closest score to twenty-one. 
It will amaze you how a little luck can go a long ways.
If the value of your hand of cards is from seventeen to nineteen I would recommend you to stay. You will still have a chance to win.
The other player still can bust or come in under you value of cards.

I hope my version of BlackJack become one of your favorites games to play. 
The goal is to have a great time trying using your skills and a little luck. Enjoy playing BlackJack.
